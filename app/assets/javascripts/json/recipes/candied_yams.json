    "instructions": "\r\n\tPreheat oven to 350°F.\r\n\tCut yams in half and boil until tender but firm (about 20 minutes). When cooled enough to handle, peel and slice into 1/4\" thickness.\r\n\tCombine sugar, flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and grated orange peel.\r\n\tCoat a medium-sized casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray. Place half of the sliced yams in the dish. Sprinkle with spiced sugar mixture.\r\n\tDot with half the amount of margarine.\r\n\tAdd a second layer of yams, using the rest of the ingredients in the same order as above. Add orange juice. \r\n\tBake uncovered in oven for 20 minutes. \r\n\r\n",

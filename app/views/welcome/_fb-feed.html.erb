            Eggplant - now in season! Just in time for June's recipe of
            the month, "Italian Eggplant Sliders." Cooking with eggplant
            is a great way to follow the MyPlate tip to vary your veggie

            like mini pizzas but are packed with nutrients and help you get
            more servings of healthy vegetables in your diet. If you try them,

            experience with a new food can help your kids like it and eat more of it.
